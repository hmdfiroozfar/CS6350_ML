The Q2_A_B_C.py script encompasses all the requisite functions pertinent to Question 2 in Homework 4. Executing this script will sequentially display the results for the Primal SVM algorithm for different settings. At first it shows the plots and errors for different values of C, a, and gamma for the first learning rate scheduler type. (Q2_A)
Then it shows the plots and errors related to different values of C and gamma while the learning rate scheduler is different. (Q2_B)
finally, it computed the differences to compare the effect of different learning rate schedulers. (Q2_C).

The script Q3_A.py encompasses all the requisite functions pertinent to Question 3 part A in Homework 4 which is about dual SVM.

The script Q3_B_C.py encompasses all the requisite functions pertinent to Question 3 part B and part C in Homework 4 which are about Gaussian SVM.
